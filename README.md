# brenbrenbakes: Brenna Baker's recipe page

***

## Decription:
This is a fun little website I have made to store and share the various recipes for the things I have been baking.
The recipes in this website may look a little different than a traditional website.
* The ingredients list is roughly in the order of when you add them.
* There is very little description for the remainder of the recipe, as you can follow along with the ingredients list.
* I do this because I am dyslexic and struggle with following traditional recipe layout.

## Usage:
* Clicking on the dropdowns will present the recipes.

## Supprt:
If you have any issues, you can email me and we can work it out.<br>
**Email:** brenna.langille@gmail.com

## Roadmap:
I haven't really set this website up yet, as I know I will change everything once I learn React.
* I plan on adding my current list of recipes.
* Organizing them based on keywords, and creating a filter to better find what you are looking for.
* There will also be a nice menu and little drawings of each bake.
